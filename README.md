# Twitter-Dashboard
Nullclass Twitter Dashboard

Dear Team,

The dashboard includes key insights such as:
- Total clicks by type (URL, profile, hashtag)
- Media views and engagement by days of the week
- Engagement rate trends over time
- Top tweets by engagement, likes, and retweets
- Interactive filters for weekday and month-wise analysis

I have attached a screenshot of the dashboard along with the Power BI (.pbix) file and the GitHub link for your reference.
